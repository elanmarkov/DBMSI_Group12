Graph Database Test Cases 
Format of command line input:

============= Phase 2 Tests =============
Batch Node Insert (Task 10 Query):
batchnodeinsert NODEFILENAME GRAPHDBNAME
NODEFILENAME should be a file in tests folder

Batch Edge Insert (Task 11 Query):
batchedgeinsert EDGEFILENAME GRAPHDBNAME
EDGEFILENAME should be a file in tests folder

Batch Node Delete (Task 12 Query):
batchnodedelete NODEFILENAME GRAPHDBNAME
NODEFILENAME should be a file in tests folder

Batch Edge Delete (Task 13 Query):
batchnodeinsert EDGEFILENAME GRAPHDBNAME
EDGEFILENAME should be a file in tests folder

Simple Node Query (Task 14 Query):
nodequery GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF QTYPE INDEX [QUERYOPTIONS]

Simple Edge Query (Task 15 Query):
edgequery GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF QTYPE INDEX [QUERYOPTIONS]


============= Phase 3 Tests =============
NL = Node Label
ND = Node Descriptor
EL = Edge Label
MW = Max Edge Weight
ME = Max Num Edges
TW = Max Total Edge Weight

Path Expression Query 1 (Task 6 Query):
PQ1 GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF a/b/c ARGS
ARGS = NN/(NN/)*/NN
NN = (NL|ND)
Example: PQ1 graph 1000 a NL1/ND1,2,3,4,5

Path Expression Query 2 (Task 7 Query):
PQ2 GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF a/b/c ARGS
ARGS = NN/EN(/EN)*
NN = (NL|ND)
EN = (EL|MW)
Example: PQ2 graph 1000 a NL1/EL2

Path Expression Query 3 (Task 8 Query):
PQ3 GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF a/b/c ARGS
ARGS = NN/Bound
NN = (NL|ND)
Bound = (ME|TW)
Example: PQ3 graph 1000 a NL1/ME5

Triangle Query (Task 9 Query):
TQA/TQB/TQC GRAPHDBNAME NUMBUF ARGS
ARGS = EN;EN;EN
EN = (EL|MW)
Example: TQA graph 1000 EL1;EL2;EL3
